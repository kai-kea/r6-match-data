# r6-match-data
this will be a tool integrating the r6-dissect tool (written in Go) with Google Cloud Platform services, so that we can store data from match replays and analyse it

## Front End Plans
- Visualization via AG Grid
  - Use Firebase functions to retrieve data
- Upload match replay via website or Google Drive

## Back End Plans
- Hierarchical store of events/rounds/games/series/tournaments
- Mutable player/operator/map info
